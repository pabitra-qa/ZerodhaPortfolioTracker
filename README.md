This application helps you quickly fetch your Zerodha holdings in few seconds.

You will have the option to send an email to yourself. You need to provide your email id and app password(not password) for the same. Check this link for a guide for app password: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en-GB

For your ease, you can use the zerodha.properties file to store your details. So that you don't have to enter it again and again.

Also to write the results to an excel file with name "Finance Master.xlsx" or "Finance Master.xlsm".

Incase your are writing to Excel, please don't change the formats or cell data. It may fail the next run.

You can run PortfolioScraper.java available here: src\main\java\ZerodhaPortfolioInsight

This code uses Playwright to interact with Zerodha Kite and Coin APIs to fetch your holdings.

Please put your suggestions. Will try to incorporate those.

Provide the credentials. Click start. Wait for 20-30 seconds. Boom. Here is your portfolio details. You can send an email or write to excel.

Thank you!
